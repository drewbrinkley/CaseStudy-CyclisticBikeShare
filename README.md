# Case Study - Trends in Cyclistic Bike Share Ridership

I completed this case study as the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.  This project used actual data from Chicago's Divvy bicycle sharing service to simulate data for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company.  Using 12 months of historical data, I identified trends in ridership between the company's membership groups (annual members and casual riders) to inform decisions about a new marketing campaign to maximize annual memberships.
